# Maze-solving
This was made to generate mazes of high dimension and solve them using adaptive algorithms with heuristics.

Exploration of various search algorithms (DFS, BSF, A*) in the application of path planning using the environment of a maze on fire.
Implemented local search algorithms of genetic search and hill-climbing in order to discover hard to solve mazes
Simulated a system in which the agent tries to solve the problem in a dynamic environment.
